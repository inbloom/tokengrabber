#API Token Grabber

##DESCRIPTION
The API Token Grabber is a developer utility designed for two
purposes:

  a.) Demostrate the OAuth2 workflow works in a few lines of PHP code.

  b.) Extract the session API token necessary to communicate with 
      the inBloom data store APIs.

Once that API token is in hand, you can use the token to interact with
the APIs without code using curl or tools like the Advanced API
Client available in the Chrome Web Store (http://goo.gl/mN1Xk).
